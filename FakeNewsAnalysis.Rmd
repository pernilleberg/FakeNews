Analyzing the spread of Fake News in a Social Network.

Outline:
  1. Short description of main questions and hypotheses 
  2. Short description of network used to simulate the spread - it's structure, which parameters etc.
  3. Data cleaning (Probably necessary)
  4. Models used for analysis: Bayesian (brms or map2stan?)
  5. Assessing model quality
  6. Results (Pretty plots and some estimates)
  

Main Questions and Hyptheses 

This paper set out to investigate how different network characteristics influence the spread of Fake News in a Social Network. Mainly, we are interested in which parameters must be present (and to what extent) to limit the spread of Fake News stories in a thightly interconnected network

  We will explore this question from two different persepectives: 1) an 'assigned-Authority' perspective, where the modulators/modifiers (named 'WatchDogs') are randomly distributed throughtout the network, and have a fixed probability of detecting fake news, and 2) a 'leave-it-to-the-population' perspective, where all agents/nodes within the network has a probability of detecting fake news, and afterwards punish the agent from which they received the Fake News by isolating it from the network (equavilent to ban someone from the Social Network platform).
  
  In essense, these perspetives represent two different approaches to try and deal with fake news on Social Media. The first persepctive, 'assigned-Authority', represent an intervention where the Network Providers (e.g. Facebook Staff) assign the task of flagging/stopping fake news to different individuals within the network. The second persepctive, 'leave-it-to-the-population', represent the idea of having the network regulate it self, leaving it to the population (its users) to detect fake news.  
  Furthermore, Social Media might be the an ideal environment for Fake News due to its structure. A social network is characterized by a high clustering coeffecient (i.e. users are thightly connected in 'cliques' or clusters). Additionally, social media is charaterized by a community structure where links are dense within communities but sparse between them.
  
  This creates two different hypotheses:
  1. The number of 'infected' nodes is predicted by the strucutre of the network (i.e. the clustering coeffecient), the number of WD, their degree of centrality, and their level of 'betweenness centrality'*.
  2. The number of 'infected' nodes is predicted by the structure of the network (i.e. the clustering coeffecient) and the probability for detecting fake news. 
  
  
  


Clustering coefficient = a measure of how likely it is that two connected nodes are part of the some larger, highly connected group of nodes (A probability measure, between 0-1).

For the WD: levels of centrality (how powerful they are) - different ways to measure this: degree of centrality (i.e. how many connections), the likelihood of them effecting what is being echanged within the network - high degree = a hub. Closeness centrality = distance (important because distances acts as a constraint). 
*Betweeness centratility = when agent acts as a bridge between two communities --> plays a critical role in what info is being transfered between communities - if social network is charaterized by a sparse link between communities, it might be interesting to see, if WD can do anything by 'blocking' the bridge between communities (probably not as litterature says that homogenous communities is the real enemy here).
